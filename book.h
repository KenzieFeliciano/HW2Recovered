//self note: the constructor needs to initialize all data members including the ones from product

//self note: the reason we re-add functions like keywords(), displayString(), and dump() even though they're already in Product class (that Book is inheriting) 
//is to tell the compiler these are the specific Book versions (function overriding/polymorphism). So we're using Book specific behavior that is not calling to the Product version (Product* to Book)

//self note: endif is to end the header so its not duplicated

//self note: what is polymorphism? It means "many forms" and lets you use a base class pointer or reference to call functions that behave differently. a Product* could point ot Book

//self note: virtual allows other classes to override those functions with more specific versions (a form of polymorphism)

//self note: class is the blueprint, constructor initializes the object you create. you might have multiple constructors if you want to have different ways of creating a book. maybe the second constructor only has some arguments like only name and author
